# AChemS RNA-seq workshop
This repo contains input file and R code for [an RNA-seq workshop I'm helping with at AChemS 2017](https://achems2017.org/web/program-workshops.php).

The input count table is from here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59324. For more details on the experiment, see [Jiang et al. 2015](http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v18/n10/abs/nn.4104.html).

The analysis output can be viewed here: https://yue-jiang.github.io/achems/.

The basic idea is to test for differentially expressed genes accounting for litter effects. This tutorial covers basics of differential expression analysis starting from the count table.
